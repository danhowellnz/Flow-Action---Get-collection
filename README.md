# Flow-Action---Get-collection

**What does it do?**

It’s a new flow action that allows you to use SOQL or SOSL to find records. That means you can start using nested SOQL statements, or leverage Salesforce's fuzzy search logic from SOSL. 

It can use
- Dynamic where clauses - define as text
- Work with any object
- Use IN statements - If you provide a list of Ids
- Bypass sharing rules (this is useful sometimes)


**Install**
- Production: https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t7F000005QzeN
- Source code: https://github.com/danhowellnz/Flow-Action---Get-collection

**How to use**

- Add an “action” to your flow and search for “Get Collection as SObject”-
- Select the object type
